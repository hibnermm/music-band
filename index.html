    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>George Miller, more commonly known as Joji, is a Japanese-Australian artist who has recently taken his claim to fame as an R&B/Hip-Hop star. He is known for his eccentric tracks which can be characterized as “trip hop and lo-fi that blends elements of trap, folk, electronic, and R&B.” He commonly incorporates a melancholic tone layered with mixing tender melodies and soulful lyrical content. Today he has transformed into one of the most highly renowned artists in his genre.
